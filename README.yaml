# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning an
  [AWS Transit Gateway Peering Connection](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway) to connect TGWs from different accounts
  and(or) regions.

  Transit Gateway does not support sharing the Transit Gateway hub across regions. You must deploy a Transit Gateway hub
  for each region and connect the alternate hub to the primary hub.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  This component is deployed to each alternate region with `tgw/hub`.

  For example if your primary region is `us-east-1` and your alternate region is `us-west-2`, deploy another `tgw/hub` in
  `us-west-2` and peer the two with `tgw/cross-region-hub-connector` with the following stack config, imported into
  `us-west-2`:

  ```yaml
  import:
    - catalog/tgw/hub

  components:
    terraform:
      # Cross region TGW requires additional hub in the alternate region
      tgw/hub:
        vars:
          # These are all connections available for spokes in this region
          # Defaults environment to this region
          connections:
            # Hub for this region is always required
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: network
            # VPN source
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: network
                environment: use1
            # Github Runners
            - account:
                tenant: core
                stage: auto
                environment: use1
              eks_component_names:
                - eks/cluster
            # All stacks where a spoke will be deployed
            - account:
                tenant: plat
                stage: dev
              eks_component_names: [] # Add clusters here once deployed

      # This alternate hub needs to be connected to the primary region's hub
      tgw/cross-region-hub-connector:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          primary_tgw_hub_region: us-east-1
